# Motion-Detection-using-Raspberry-Pi-3-and-CSI-camera

This project is about a motion detector using a raspberry pi and raspberry pi camera module. It is based on Raspberry pi motion sensing using the PIR sensor for measurement and it is distinctive as it not only detects motion from the sensor but also displays data on screen and Detecting motion with PIR sensor and sending the Raspberry Pi camera image as email.
